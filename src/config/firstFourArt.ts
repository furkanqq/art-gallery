      "The Creation of Adam (Italian: Creazione di Adamo), also known as The Creation of Man:  plate 54  is a fresco painting by Italian artist Michelangelo, which forms part of the Sistine Chapel's ceiling, painted c. 1508–1512. It illustrates the Biblical creation narrative from the Book of Genesis in which God gives life to Adam, the first man. The fresco is part of a complex iconographic scheme and is chronologically the fourth in the series of panels depicting episodes from Genesis. The painting has been reproduced in countless imitations and parodies. Michelangelo's Creation of Adam is one of the most replicated religious paintings of all time.",

    description:
      "Nighthawks is a 1942 oil-on-canvas painting by the American artist Edward Hopper that portrays four people in a downtown diner late at night as viewed through the diner's large glass window. The light coming from the diner illuminates a darkened and deserted urban streetscape. <br /> <br /> It has been described as Hopper's best-known work and is one of the most recognizable paintings in American art. <br /> <br /> It has been suggested that Hopper was inspired by a short story of Ernest Hemingway's, either 'The Killers' (1927), which Hopper greatly admired, or from the more philosophical 'A Clean, Well-Lighted Place' (1933). In response to a query on loneliness and emptiness in the painting, Hopper outlined that he 'didn't see it as particularly lonely'. He said, 'Unconsciously, probably, I was painting the loneliness of a large city.'",

    description:
      "The Potato Eaters (Dutch: De Aardappeleters) is an oil painting by Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh painted in April 1885 in Nuenen, Netherlands. <br /> <br /> It is in the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam. The original oil sketch is at the Kröller-Müller Museum in Otterlo, and he made lithographs of the image, which are held in collections including the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. The painting is considered to be one of Van Gogh's masterpieces. <br /> <br /> During March and the beginning of April 1885, Van Gogh sketched studies for the painting and corresponded with his brother Theo, who was not impressed with his current work nor the sketches Van Gogh sent him in Paris. He began working on The Potato Eaters while living with his parents in Nuenen, a rural town which was home to many farmers, labourers and weavers. <br /> <br /> Van Gogh said he wanted to depict peasants as they really were. He deliberately chose coarse and ugly models, thinking that they would be natural and unspoiled in his finished work.",
